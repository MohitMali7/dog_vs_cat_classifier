Welcome to the Data Science Projects Showcase repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my hands-on data science projects, showcasing a diverse range of skills and applications. From exploratory data analysis to machine learning and deep learning models.


Project: Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

Overview:
In this project, we employ deep learning techniques to build an image classifier capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images and can predict the category of a given image.
